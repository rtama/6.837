Build Instructions (Athena with Makefile)
==================
I used the standard Cmake build system to compile my code


Submission
==========

I did not collaborate with anyone in the class. 

I only used lecture notes, and piazza as references. 

There are no problems that I am aware of. 

I did not do any of the extra credit.

Project Proposal - Rigid Body Simulation
========================================

My goal for this project is to extend the work we've done in particle systems (cloth, pendulum) into rigid body simulations. In pset 3 we explored the idea of mass-spring systems and were able to simulate cloth and collisions (I did not complete collisions for the pset). 

I think that it would be a very intricate and interesting problem to explore. Firstly, we did not cover this topic in class and therefore would require research outside of class to implement. I also find the physics behind these simulations very interesting, and would like to delve more into dynamics of the system when everything isn't a particle. I think this would be interesting because it would open the possibility to play with the interactions between particle systems (cloth, fluids) and rigid bodies. This is also important because most objects in our world are rigid bodies. This would expand the range of systems that we can simulate. For example, we could make a bowling simulation, or simulate massive amounts of falling bowling pins, or simulate fluid interacting with a boat. 

This problem has certainly been tackled before. Animated movies and video games very often include rigid body dynamics. My goal is to simply simulate a physical interaction while extending our previous works. I think that extending our work on particle systems will aid this project because much of the scaffolding is in place to build new systems off of. This will allow me to focus more on the physics, and dynamics of these systems. Also, I forsee that this type of simulation could be very expensive if I do not focus on optimizing the system. If I can simulate a nontrivial amount of collisions in real-time, I would be very satisfied with my project. 

The substantial programming component of this project will be in developing the physics and representation for rigid bodies and developing the collision detectors for this system. While I will be utilizing the code from the pset, I still forsee there being a very substantial amount of new material. 
 
I will be working on my own for this project.
